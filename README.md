# Lowbar

## Notes

I have combined two Northcoders sprints, Lowbar and Advanced Lowbar, into one repository. These sprints involved implementing Underscore functions with pure JavaScript, and testing them in Mocha and Chai.

---

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/dentednerd/LowbarAdv.git`
2. Install the necessary NPM modules: `npm i`
3. Run the tests for all the functions: `npm t`

---

## Core Functions
1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains

### Extra Credit
11. pluck
12. reduce
13. every
14. some
15. extends
16. defaults

## Advanced Functions

17. once
18. memoize
19. shuffle
20. invoke
21. sortBy
22. zip
23. sortedIndex
24. flatten
25. intersection
26. difference

### Extra Credit
27. indexOf (again, this time with a binary search)

## Goals

In this sprint I:

1. Continued to practice TDD.
2. Got an inside view of Underscore, and got used to reading its API documentation.
3. Became accustomed to using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to find and install JS libraries.
4. Learned to effectively pair program, and to use Git/Github as a collaboration tool.
5. Began to understand the functional style of programming.

I heavily referenced these APIs:

1. [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
2. [The Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/)
3. [The Chai Assertion Library](http://chaijs.com/)
